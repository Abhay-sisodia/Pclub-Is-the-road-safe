# Pclub-Is-the-road-safe

Ans b)  I have taken road safety data from kaggle and applied machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression , Random Forest Regression to relate number of road accidents to various factors like speed, weather etc.

The link for the data set is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qasimhassan/reducing-the-number-of-high-fatality-accidents?select=accident-data.csv

Ans c) After gaininig insights from the data with the hep of exploratory data analysis and analyzing the correlations present in the dataset ,I have applied these algorithms on my dataset and finally i've decided to go with Linear Regression since it is giving the lowest mean_squared_error 

Algorithm                          ---- Mean_squared_error

Decision Tree Regression            ---- 0.9301236044657097

Random Forest Regression            ---- 0.4226970793460925

Linear Regression                  ----  0.4031674958482056

I have also used other parameter of evaluations also like mean_absolute_error,r2_score etc . They were also forming a similar trend.
So that's why i have decided to go with Linear_Regression algorithm.
